## Data Source
Moneypuck: NHL Stats https://moneypuck.com/data.htm

## Introduction
I attempted to figure out why the Carolina Hurricanes struggled to perform in the playoffs by analyzing their regular season statistics. I focused mostly on the issue I noticed of the poor ability to capitalize on goal-scoring opportunities. I know the Hurricanes won lots of game and came second in the conference, but with how we played most of the season it seems like we always fall short when it matters most. The goal was to determine how poor goal scoring in high danger opportunities leads to the team losing games we should have won. This is evaluated at the team level per game and also at the player level across the season.

## Data Extraction/Prepartion
One of the reasons I choose Moneypuck as the source was the data was already organized and clean, which allowed me to ingest good data from the start. The one thing that was required though was for the different views that I wanted, I needed multiple sources. I started with the Team Data which included all 32 teams so I filtered it to only the Carolina Hurricanes. The team data file had included seasons all the way back to 2008 but I only focused on the most recent complete season. I also needed player data so I got for all players in the league for the 23/24 NHL season and filtered it down to Carolina Hurricanes players.

## Future Work
One lapse in the datasource was that for the players data, I only had a season overview instead of at the game level. I think it would have been much more insightful to see how each player performed on different points in the season and against different teams. I had to compare the teams at a game level and the players at the season level so it was slightly tough to make consistant graphs.
